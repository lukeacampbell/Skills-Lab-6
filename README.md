# Simple Greeting Program

## Description
This program greets the user by their name and asks for their favorite color. It then outputs a personalized message that includes both the user's name and favorite color.

## How it Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter their name.
2. It then asks for the user's favorite color.
3. Finally, it combines both inputs into a friendly greeting message.
